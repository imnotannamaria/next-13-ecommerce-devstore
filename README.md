## Cache & Memorization

### Cache

Refers to the temporary storage of data to reduce the need to recalculate or retrieve that data repeatedly. It helps improve performance and efficiency, allowing pages to load faster.

### Memorization

refers to the technique of caching the results of costly computations to avoid recalculating the same values ​​in the future. This results in faster response time and better system efficiency, as repetitive queries or complex operations can be served quickly from the cache.
